# Monster Maze
 Monster Maze game is a "choose your own ending"-style game, where you must select one of several options to reach the next stage. In Monster Maze, you will travel through a series of rooms with the goal of winning the treasure. Each room can lead to other rooms, to a monster, or to the treasure. If you fight the monster and win, you win the treasure! But if you fight the monster and lose, you lose the game. 
 
 Here is a depiction of a maze that the Monster Maze project could model:

 In this maze, each room has the following options:

* Room 1: Can travel to room 2 or room 3
* Room 2: Can fight a monster to (hopefully) win the treasure!
* Room 3: Can fight a monster, or can travel to room 4
* Room 4: Can claim the treasure!
